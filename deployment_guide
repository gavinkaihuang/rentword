Deployment Guide: New Machine Setup
Follow these steps to set up the RentWord vocabulary application on a new computer.

Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure Node.js (version 18+ recommended) is installed.
Git: Ensure Git is installed.
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and clone your repository.

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rentword.git
cd rentword
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required project libraries.

npm install
Step 3: Configure Environment
Create a file named .env in the root directory.
Add the following content (adjust file:./dev.db if you want the database elsewhere, but default is fine):
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
Note: The database file itself is usually NOT committed to Git to prevent overwriting user data. You will generate a fresh one in the next step.
Step 4: Initialize Database
Sync the database schema to verify connections and create the local SQLite file.

npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
Step 5: Build the Application
Compile the code for production.

npm run build
Step 6: Start the Server
Launch the application.

npm run start
The app should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Optional: Data Import
If you want to transfer your existing progress from the old machine:

Stop the new server.
Copy the dev.db file from your old machine's root directory.
Paste it into the root directory of the new machine (overwrite the empty one).
Restart the server (npm run start).
